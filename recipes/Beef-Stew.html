        <p>Who doesn’t love a hearty bowl of rich and flavorful beef stew? It’s such a traditional Fall and Winter comfort food. I’ve been working on slight variations of this recipe for years and I have to say, this version is definitely the best ever.</p>
        <p>All of the ingredients in this recipe compliment each other so well, and the quantities of each are perfect, with no ingredient overpowering another.</p>        
        <p>Let’s get into everything you need to know. From the what cuts of beef to use, the best potatoes for stew,  pro tips, storage, and more:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds stew meat, see notes</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>3-6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons cold butter, separated</li>
            <li>2 cups yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup high-quality cabernet sauvignon, merlot works as well. See notes.</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tsp better than bouillon, or 2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>5 medium carrots, cut into chunks, about 1-inch</li>
            <li>1 lb. baby Yukon gold potatoes, halved or quartered</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 sprig rosemary</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Cold Water + 3 tablespoons Corn Starch, Optional</li>
            <li>2-3 drops Gravy Master, (Optional)- Adds an even richer darker color</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut meat into 1-inch cubes, discard any large pieces of fat. Fat marbleized into the meat is fine!</li>
            <li>Sprinkle beef with black pepper, garlic salt, and celery salt. Toss to coat. Sprinkle flour over the meat and toss again.</li>
            <li>Heat 3 Tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat in batches, don’t overcrowd the pan. Brown on each side for 45 seconds. Add more oil if needed. Transfer to slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and melt 1 Tablespoon butter. Add onions and cook for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Use a silicone spatula to clean the bottom of the pan, removing any brown remnants. This will give the soup lots of good flavor. If necessary, add a splash of wine to help loosen it. Transfer the onions/garlic mixture to the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Add all remaining ingredients except for the peas, corn starch mixture, and 2 tablespoons of cold butter.</li>
            <li>Cook on low for 7 ½ to 8 hours or high for 3½ to 4 hours, until the vegetables are softened and the potatoes are fork tender.</li>
            <li>Add the peas during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Remove the bay leaves and rosemary stem.</li>
            <li>Optional: To thicken, combine ¼ cup COLD water with 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch. Slowly add it to the stew, stirring to incorporate. It will continue to thicken upon standing.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat. Swirl in 2 tablespoons of cold butter for a smooth, velvety finish. This is a technique that chefs use called “Monter au Beurre”.</li>
                Optional: Add 3 drops of Gravy Master (or Kitchen Bouquet) for an even darker color.</li>
        </ol>
